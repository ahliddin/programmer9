Below are the notes from the book by Barbara Oakley - A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science.  
In the square brackets I put my personal comments.  

***
There are two thinking modes - **focused mode** and **diffuse mode**.   
*Focused mode* is when the brain is in highly attentive state, whereas *diffuse mode* is when the brain in more relaxed resting state.
 
***
If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, your best bet is to turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on your *big picture* diffuse mode,
Diffuse-mode thinking is what happens when you relax your attention and just let your mind wander.
This relaxation can allow different areas of the brain to hook up and return valuable insights.  
 
<div class="note-comment">
This suggestion is similar to the one by Andy Hunt in [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://programmer9.com/2020/12/20/booknotes-pragmatic-thinking-and-learning.html), 
where he emphasised that it is important to keep your train of thoughts during the *"diffuse"* mode.
Switching to reading news or emails or chatting with friends about plans for weekend won't help, but taking a walk, doing dishes while keeping the problem in mind might help.

To avoid procrastination [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)  could help.
<div class="note-comment"> 
From my personal experience using Pomodoro Technique all the time is redundant, because it adds extra burden to the process.  
Sometimes it is even disturbing, because when you are *in the zone* 25 minutes passes very fast and you get suddenly interrupted by some Pomodoro app telling you to take a break.  
However I found it very useful when I am exceptionally lazy or not motivated and try to avoid work at all costs. 
In those cases the commitment to work for 25 mins without interruption helps a lot.
I tried several apps and browser extensions and I liked the most the [Forrest](https://www.forestapp.cc), where you grow a virtual tree which dies if you interrupt the committed time for work/study.

It's best to word on math and science in small docese - a little every day. This will allow both modes to do the thing. 

***
Spaced repetitions help move items from working memory (RAM of brain) to long-term memory (hard drive of brain).

***
Sleep is important! Thinking of problem before sleep will help.
