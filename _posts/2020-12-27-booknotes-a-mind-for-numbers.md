Below are the notes from the book by Barbara Oakley - A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science.  
In the square brackets I put my personal comments.

If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, your best bet is to turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on your *big picture* diffuse mode.  
\[This suggestion is similar to the one by Andy Hunt in [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://programmer9.com/2020/12/20/booknotes-pragmatic-thinking-and-learning.html), 
where he emphasised that it is important to keep your train of thoughts during the *"diffused"* mode.
Switching to reading news or emails or chatting with friends about plans for weekend won't help, but taking a walk, doing dishes while keeping the problem in mind might help.\]

To avoid procrastination 25 mins work and 5 mins rest (Pomodoro technique) could help.
*Personal note:*  
\[From my personal experience using Pomodoro technique all the time is redundant, it just adds extra bureaucracy to the process.  
It might even be disturbing, because when you are in the zone 25 minutes feels like 2 minutes you get suddenly interrupted by some Pomodoro application telling you to take a break.   
I found it useful in the moments when I am exceptionally lazy or not motivated and try to avoid work at all costs. 
In those cases the commitment to work for 25 mins without interruption helps a lot.
From all the applications and browser extensions that I tried, I liked the most the [Forrest](https://www.forestapp.cc)\], where you grow a virtual tree which dies if you interrupt.
