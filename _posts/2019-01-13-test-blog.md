This is my first test blog post.
More is on the way


### Why am I doing it?

I like programming, reading programming-related blog posts and I like languages (not only programming, but real ones too).
There are loads of very good content in russian languages, but it's not available in other languages.
The same is true with the othe way round. There are loads of very good posts in English but no in Russian, and there are lots of russians who don't know English.


 _Prerequisite_

You have to be interested in IT and Software Development


Here some Java code
{% highlight java %}

public class Test {
    public static void main (String ... args) {
        System.out.println("Hello the bloody world! Prepare for my great posts and tutorials");
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
