Below are the notes from the book by Glen Arnold - [FT Guide to Banking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19620502-ft-guide-to-banking).

***
Bolts of silk, silver, gold were used as mediums of exchange, a type of currency. Those were pain to carry.
Solution: the authorities set up depositories to deposit coins. They received in return a piece of paper promising that
a sum of money could be taken from any of the depositories. (Mesopotamia 4400 years ago).  
Merchants started issuing paper money themselves based on there coin vaults, to buy things for there business.
Later they started issuing paper money even if they didn't have sufficient back up of gold and silver, that's when government
stepped in to regulate money issuing.

***
**Liquidity** - the extent of which an asset can be sold quickly for cash, at low transaction cost without moving the price against you.

***
**Treasury bills** - a promise on a piece of paper that Treasury of the nation will pay the holder in few days. When they
returned to the capital the merchants could exchange the bills for bronze coin.

***
**Secondary market** - where the treasury bills would be traded for prices lower than their nominal.  
**Primary market** - where the original deal is done with the finance raiser - the State in case of bonds - and the lender.

***
**Fractional Reserve Banking** - only fraction of the money deposited is actually held in reserve. The rest is lended out to gain interest.

***
**Cheque** - a piece of paper ordering a bank to pay a specific amount of money from a person's account to another person named in cheque. 

***
**Clearing house** - in 1770 the London bankers gathered together in one place to handle the cheques from many banks, that's the birth of Bankers' Clearing House.

***
*Primary investors* - the savers of society, it is these individuals who become the main providers of funds used for investment in the business sector.
They like high liquidity and low risk.

***
*Ultimate borrowers* - business sector (mainly long-term loans). Low liquidity, high risks, large amounts.

***
**Broker** - intermediary someone who matches up a provider of finance with a user of funds. Reduces the search costs for both parties.  
*Stockbrokers*, for example, make it easy for investors wanting to buy shares. Investment banks act as brokers in the bond market.

***
*Syndicated lending* - used for large long-term loans (5-10 years). Multiple banks spread their lending to gain the risk-reducing benefits of diversification.

***
*Interbank market* - where banks lend to each other. If a bank has surplus of money not being used it places it to gain interest.

***
**Retail banks** take (small) deposits from the public which are re-packaged and lent to small businesses and households.
This is generally high-volume and low-value business which contrasts with ***wholesale banking** which is low volume but each transaction is for a high value.
For example, *wholesale banks* obtain a great deal of the money they use from the sale of financial instruments in the markets,
in values of tens or hundreds of millions of pounds, dollars, euros, etc.  
*Universal bank* - offers full range of banking.


***
**Liquidity management** - bank need to keep enough cash to satisfy customers withdrawing money. There may be times when
a large volume is withdrawn and bank has to be ready.  
Ultra-safe banks hold 20% more assets than liabilities. Normally banks hold just 3-4% though.  
**Assets** - loans made.  
**Liabilities** - deposits (and other loads to the bank).  
**Permanent Capital** - money put in by its owners. Can't be withdrawn, but shares could be sold.
