Below are the notes from the book by Glen Arnold - [FT Guide to Banking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19620502-ft-guide-to-banking).

Bolts of silk, silver, gold were used as mediums of exchange, a type of currency. Those were pain to carry.
Solution: the authorities set up depositories to deposit coins. They received in return a piece of paper promising that
a sum of money could be taken from any of the depositories. (Mesopotamia 4400 years ago).  
Merchants started issuing paper money themselves based on there coin vaults, to buy things for there business.
Later they started issuing paper money even if they didn't have sufficient back up of gold and silver, that's when government
stepped in to regulate money issuing.

**Liquidity** - the extent of which an asset can be sold quickly for cash, at low transaction cost without moving the price against you.

***
**Treasury bills** - a promise on a piece of paper that Treasury of the nation will pay the holder in few days. When they
returned to the capital the merchants could exchange the bills for bronze coin.

***
**Secondary market** - where the treasury bills would be traded for prices lower than their nominal.  
**Primary market** - where the original deal is done with the finance raiser - the State in case of bonds - and the lender.

***
**Fractional Reserve Banking** - only fraction of the money deposited is actually held in reserve. The rest is lended out to gain interest.

***
**Cheque** - a piece of paper ordering a bank to pay a specific amount of money from a person's account to another person named in cheque. 

***
**Clearing house** - in 1770 the London bankers gathered together in one place to handle the cheques from many banks, that's the birth of Bankers' Clearing House.
