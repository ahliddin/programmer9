description: The results of the survey with 10,500 Java developer participants

Recently I read a great article by [Simon Maple](https://twitter.com/sjmaple) and [Andrew Binstock](https://twitter.com/platypusguy) -
_The Largest Survey Ever of Java Developers_ on [Java Magazine](http://www.javamagazine.mozaicreader.com).
There were 10,500 Java developers participating in the survey.

Here's an extract of what I found most interesting.

#### Which Java vendorâ€™s JDK do you use in production for your main applications?
The obvious winners so far are Oracle JDK and OpenJDK. Although with upcoming changes in licencing and support the figures might quite change in a next survey.
I didn't quite understand how 1% of those Java developers survive programming in *Java* with *'None'* JDK. I didn't find any explanation in the original article as well.

#### What Java EE version do you use for your main applications?
38% of Java developers don't use Java EE at all. Hello, [Spring Framework](https://spring.io) :-).
Probably there are some Swing and JavaFX developers among them too, though.

#### What is the principal JVM language you use for your main applications?

Java is a badass dominant here.
Considering that for the past few years people have been talking about *Kotlin* a lot, only 2.42% of respondents use it as a primary language in their projects.
Although it beats *Scala*, I'm surprised to see it's behind *Clojure*.

#### Which IDE do you develop with?
IntelliJ IDEA is the best IDE I ever coded in. I used Eclipse and NetBeans before, but once I tried IntelliJ I never went back.
I have nothing against *vi/vim* editor, I love to use them for quick editing of files or writing *bash* scripts.
In fact, I think that any developer should have some basic knowledge of using *vim* and some *bash* scripting.
But using it as an IDE for Java project.. come on. If those 3% of respondents were actually serious about using *vi/vim* as a primary IDE,
then they probably commute to work on horses and treat appendicitis with blood-lettings and laxatives.
