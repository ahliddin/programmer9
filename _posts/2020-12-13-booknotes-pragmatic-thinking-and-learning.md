*It's been almost 2 years since I posted anything, ironically my last post was about the book  [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://programmer9.com/2019/02/17/booknotes-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f_ck.html) *

*Anyways here are the notes from the book I read years ago [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware](https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/) by Andy Hunt and here are the quotes I liked most:*

***
Alcohol and aging can kill neurons (brain cells), but in rich environment with things to learn, observe, and interact with, you will grow plenty of new neurons and new connections between them.
***
Step away from computer to solve hard problems. Go for a walk. Keep the problem in your mind, but don't focus on it - the solution will bubble out.
***
Change viewpoint: imagine you are part of the component, e.g. you are a database query: when tired of waiting what will you do? Who would you tell?
***
The technique to read deliberately.  
**SQ3R:**
- *Survey* - scan table of contents, summaries for overview
- *Question* - note any question you have
- *Read* - read in it's entirety
- *Recite* - summarize, take notes, put in your own words
- *Review* - reread, expand notes, discuss with your colleagues/friends

***
- Make a mindmap for the next book you read
- Make a mindmap for your career, lifestyle plans, vacation
- Experiment with colored pencils, etc.
- Keep iterating, often you think you're done - add just one more thing
***
Write on: documenting is more important than documentation
***
Not knowing is ok - not doing anything about it, is not. If you come across something you don't know - explore, google it up, etc.
***
We learn best by discovery, not instructions; just be aware! 
***
Don't jump to fix an apparent bug without fully evaluating what's really wrong first. 
Fight the urge to rush to judgement or to premature fix.
Be fully aware of how the system works/behaving and only then decide what part of that is *wrong* before moving to device the solution.
***
We are natural mimics - mimic the experts, greats, pros! If you do all the expert does, you'll get same results.
***
Groove your mind for success!
***
Work with C++ for a while - then Java will seem easier :-)
***
Be the expert. Don't just pretend, actually play the role of the expert. Notice how this changes your behavior. 
***
**Manage Focus/Defocus**
Learn to pay attention - meditation ([Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81)) helps.
